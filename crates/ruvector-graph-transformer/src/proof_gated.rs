//! Proof-gated mutation substrate.
//!
//! The core `ProofGate<T>` type wraps mutations behind formal proofs.
//! Every mutation to graph state must pass through a proof gate, ensuring
//! that invariants are maintained and attestation chains are recorded.
//!
//! ## ADR-047 Types
//!
//! - [`MutationLedger`]: Append-only attestation log with FNV-1a chain hash
//! - [`ProofScope`]: Partition-aligned scope tied to min-cut boundaries
//! - [`SupersessionProof`]: Forward-only rollback via supersession
//! - [`EpochBoundary`]: Seal attestation for proof algebra upgrades
//! - [`ProofRequirement`]: Typed proof obligation variants
//! - [`ComplexityBound`]: Upper bounds on proof computation cost
//! - [`ProofClass`]: Formal vs statistical proof classification

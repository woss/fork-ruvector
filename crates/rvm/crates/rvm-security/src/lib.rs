//! # RVM Security Policy
//!
//! Security policy enforcement for the RVM microhypervisor. This crate
//! provides the policy decision point that combines capability checks,
//! proof verification, and witness logging into a unified security gate.
//!
//! ## Security Model
//!
//! Every hypercall passes through a three-stage gate:
//!
//! 1. **Capability check** -- Does the caller hold the required rights?
//! 2. **Proof verification** -- Is the state transition properly attested?
//! 3. **Witness logging** -- Record the decision for future audit
//!
//! Only after all three stages pass does the hypercall proceed.
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - [`gate`] -- Unified security gate (single entry point)
//! - [`validation`] -- Input validation for security-critical parameters
//! - [`attestation`] -- Attestation chain and report generation
//! - [`budget`] -- DMA and resource budget enforcement

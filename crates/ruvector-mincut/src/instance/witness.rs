//! Witness types for cut certification
//!
//! A witness represents a connected set U ⊆ V with its boundary δ(U).
//! The witness certifies that a proper cut exists with value |δ(U)|.
//!
//! # Representation
//!
//! Witnesses use an implicit representation for memory efficiency:
//! - **Seed vertex**: The starting vertex that defines the connected component
//! - **Membership bitmap**: Compressed bitmap indicating which vertices are in U
//! - **Boundary size**: Pre-computed value |δ(U)| for O(1) queries
//! - **Hash**: Fast equality checking without full comparison
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! - `WitnessHandle` uses `Arc` for cheap cloning (O(1))
//! - `contains()` is O(1) via bitmap lookup
//! - `boundary_size()` is O(1) via cached value
//! - `materialize_partition()` is O(|V|) and should be used sparingly

## Privacy & Ethics

### Critical Guidelines

**SYNTHETIC DATA ONLY**
- All data is 100% synthetic and generated by AI
- No real employee data is included or should be used
- Never train models on real employee data without consent

**ETHICAL USE**
- Use only for system testing and planning
- Never use to make actual decisions about real employees
- Maintain appropriate security for even synthetic HR data
- Be aware of and mitigate algorithmic bias

**PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS**
- Treat synthetic data as if it were real (practice good habits)
- Don't mix synthetic and real data
- Follow all applicable privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Document that data is synthetic in all systems

**BIAS MITIGATION**
- Simulations include diverse populations
- Avoid reinforcing stereotypes
- Include representation across all demographics
- Test for disparate impact in any derived models

**COMPLIANCE**
- Ensure generated data complies with equal employment laws
- Don't generate protected class data inappropriately
- Follow pay equity and anti-discrimination guidelines
- Consult legal counsel for production use

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { generateWorkSchedules } from './workforce-behavior.js';
import { generateKPIData } from './performance-data.js';

// Generate 500 realistic work schedules
const schedules = await generateWorkSchedules();
console.log(`Generated ${schedules.data.length} schedules`);

// Generate performance KPI data
const kpis = await generateKPIData();
console.log(`Generated ${kpis.data.length} KPI records`);
```

### Batch Generation

```typescript
import { createSynth } from '../../src/index.js';

const synth = createSynth({
  provider: 'gemini',
  apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY,
  cacheStrategy: 'memory'
});

// Generate multiple datasets in parallel
const [schedules, performance, reviews] = await Promise.all([
  synth.generateStructured({ count: 1000, schema: scheduleSchema }),
  synth.generateStructured({ count: 500, schema: performanceSchema }),
  synth.generateStructured({ count: 300, schema: reviewSchema })
]);
```

### Streaming Generation

```typescript
import { createSynth } from '../../src/index.js';

const synth = createSynth({ streaming: true });

// Stream productivity data
for await (const dataPoint of synth.generateStream('timeseries', {
  count: 5000,
  interval: '1h',
  metrics: ['productivityScore', 'focusLevel']
})) {
  // Process each data point as it's generated
  await processProductivityData(dataPoint);
}
```

### Custom Scenarios

```typescript
// Generate data for specific scenarios
const seniorEngineerSchema = {
  role: { type: 'string', default: 'senior_engineer' },
  yearsExperience: { type: 'number', min: 5, max: 15 },
  // ... more fields
};

const result = await synth.generateStructured({
  count: 100,
  schema: seniorEngineerSchema,
  context: 'Generate profiles for senior engineers in a fast-growing startup'
});
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for AI-powered generation
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Optional: Alternative providers
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
```

### Generation Options

```typescript
const config = {
  provider: 'gemini', // or 'openrouter'
  model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp', // or specific model
  cacheStrategy: 'memory', // Enable caching for faster re-runs
  cacheTTL: 3600, // Cache for 1 hour
  maxRetries: 3,
  timeout: 30000
};
```

## Data Quality

### Realism Features

- **Statistical Accuracy**: Distributions match industry benchmarks
- **Temporal Patterns**: Seasonal and cyclical variations
- **Correlations**: Realistic relationships between variables
- **Edge Cases**: Includes outliers and unusual patterns
- **Diversity**: Represents varied demographics and experiences

### Validation

Each example includes:
- Schema validation for data structure
- Range validation for numeric values
- Enum validation for categorical data
- Relationship validation for correlated fields
- Statistical validation against benchmarks

## Performance

- **Generation Speed**: 100-1000 records/second (cached)
- **Memory Usage**: ~1MB per 1000 records
- **Batch Processing**: Parallel generation for large datasets
- **Streaming**: Low memory footprint for large volumes

## Integration

### HR Systems
- Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle HCM
- BambooHR, Namely, Rippling
- Custom HRIS implementations

### Analytics Platforms
- Tableau, Power BI, Looker
- People analytics tools
- Custom dashboards

### Machine Learning
- Sklearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- Feature engineering pipelines
- Model training and validation

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
```typescript
// Generate small sample first
const sample = await generateKPIData();
console.log(sample.data.slice(0, 3)); // Review quality
```

### 2. Use Caching
```typescript
// Enable caching for iterative development
const synth = createSynth({ cacheStrategy: 'memory' });
```

### 3. Validate Output
```typescript
// Check data quality
const result = await synth.generateStructured({ count: 100, schema });
assert(result.data.every(r => r.salary > 0));
```

### 4. Document Usage
```typescript
// Always document that data is synthetic
const metadata = {
  synthetic: true,
  generated: new Date(),
  purpose: 'Testing HRIS integration',
  source: 'agentic-synth'
};
```

### 5. Test Edge Cases
```typescript
// Include edge cases in generation
const context = `
  Include edge cases:
  - New hires (0-90 days)
  - Long tenure (10+ years)
  - High performers and strugglers
  - Various leave scenarios
`;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Slow Generation**
- Enable caching: `cacheStrategy: 'memory'`
- Use batch processing for large volumes
- Consider using faster models

**Unrealistic Data**
- Adjust context prompts for more specificity
- Review and refine schemas
- Add validation constraints

**Memory Issues**
- Use streaming for large datasets
- Process in batches
- Clear cache periodically

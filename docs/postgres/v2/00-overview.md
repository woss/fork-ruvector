# RuVector Postgres v2 - Architecture Overview

## What We're Building

Most databases, including vector databases, are **performance-first systems**. They optimize for speed, recall, and throughput, then bolt on monitoring. Structural safety is assumed, not measured.

RuVector does something different.

We give the system a **continuous, internal measure of its own structural integrity**, and the ability to **change its own behavior based on that signal**.

This puts RuVector in a very small class of systems.

---

## Why This Actually Matters

### 1. From Symptom Monitoring to Causal Monitoring

Everyone else watches outputs: latency, errors, recall.

We watch **connectivity and dependence**, which are upstream causes.

By the time latency spikes, the graph has already weakened. We detect that weakening while everything still looks healthy.

> **This is the difference between a smoke alarm and a structural stress sensor.**

### 2. Mincut Is a Leading Indicator, Not a Metric

Mincut answers a question no metric answers:

> *"How close is this system to splitting?"*

Not how slow it is. Not how many errors. **How close it is to losing coherence.**

That is a different axis of observability.

### 3. An Algorithm Becomes a Control Signal

Most people use graph algorithms for analysis. We use mincut to **gate behavior**.

That makes it a **control plane**, not analytics.

Very few production systems have mathematically grounded control loops.

### 4. Failure Mode Changes Class

| Without Integrity Control | With Integrity Control |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Fast → stressed → cascading failure → manual recovery | Fast → stressed → scope reduction → graceful degradation → automatic recovery |

Changing failure mode is what separates hobby systems from infrastructure.

### 5. Explainable Operations

The **witness edges** are huge.

When something slows down or freezes, we can say: *"Here are the exact links that would have failed next."*

That is gold in production, audits, and regulated environments.

---

## Why Nobody Else Has Done This

Not because it's impossible. Because:

1. **Most systems don't model themselves as graphs** — we do
2. **Mincut was too expensive dynamically** — we use contracted graphs (~1000 nodes, not millions)
3. **Ops culture reacts, it doesn't preempt** — we preempt
4. **Survivability isn't a KPI until after outages** — we measure it continuously

---

## The Honest Framing

Will this get applause from model benchmarks or social media? No.

Will this make systems boringly reliable and therefore indispensable? Yes.

Those are the ideas that end up everywhere.

**We're not making vector search faster. We're making vector infrastructure survivable.**

---

## What This Is, Concretely

RuVector Postgres v2 is a **PostgreSQL extension** (built with pgrx) that provides:

- **100% pgvector compatibility** — drop-in replacement, change extension name, queries work unchanged
- **Architecture separation** — PostgreSQL handles ACID/joins, RuVector handles vectors/graphs/learning
- **Dynamic mincut integrity gating** — the control plane described above
- **Self-learning pipeline** — GNN-based query optimization that improves over time
- **Tiered storage** — automatic hot/warm/cool/cold management with compression
- **Graph engine with Cypher** — property graphs with SQL joins

|  - Mincut integrity control                                       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Core Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **pgrx for extension** | Safe Rust bindings, modern build system, well-maintained |
| **Background worker pattern** | Long-lived engine, avoid per-query initialization |
| **Shared memory IPC** | Bounded request queue with explicit payload limits (see [02-background-workers](02-background-workers.md)) |
| **WAL as source of truth** | Leverage Postgres replication, durability guarantees |
| **Contracted mincut graph** | Never compute on full similarity - use operational graph |
| **Hybrid consistency** | Synchronous hot tier, async background ops (see [10-consistency-replication](10-consistency-replication.md)) |

## Data Flow Patterns

### Vector Search (Read Path)

```
1. Client: SELECT ... ORDER BY embedding <-> $query LIMIT k

2. PostgreSQL Planner:
   - Recognizes index on embedding column
   - Generates Index Scan plan using ruhnsw

3. Index AM (amgettuple):
   - Submits search request to shared memory queue
   - Engine worker receives request

4. RuVector Engine:
   - Checks integrity gate (normal state: proceed)
   - Executes HNSW greedy search
   - Applies post-filter if needed
   - Returns top-k with distances

5. Index AM:
   - Fetches results from shared memory
   - Returns TIDs to executor

6. PostgreSQL Executor:
   - Fetches heap tuples
   - Applies remaining WHERE clauses
   - Returns to client
```

### Vector Insert (Write Path)

```
1. Client: INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ($vec)

2. PostgreSQL Executor:
   - Assigns TID, writes heap tuple
   - Generates WAL record

3. Index AM (aminsert):
   - Checks integrity gate (normal: proceed, stress: throttle)
   - Submits insert to engine queue

4. RuVector Engine:
   - Integrates vector into HNSW graph
   - Updates tier counters
   - Writes to hot tier

5. WAL Writer:
   - Persists operation for durability

6. Replication (if configured):
   - Streams WAL to replicas
   - Replicas apply via engine
```

### Integrity Gating

```
1. Background Worker (periodic):
   - Samples contracted operational graph
   - Computes lambda_cut (minimum cut value) on contracted graph
   - Optionally computes lambda2 (algebraic connectivity) as drift signal
   - Updates integrity state in shared memory

2. Any Operation:
   - Reads current integrity state
   - normal (lambda > T_high): allow all
   - stress (T_low < lambda < T_high): throttle bulk ops
   - critical (lambda < T_low): freeze mutations

3. On State Change:
   - Logs signed integrity event
   - Notifies waiting operations
   - Adjusts background worker priorities
```

## Deployment Modes

### Mode 1: Single Postgres Embedded

```
+--------------------------------------------+
|            PostgreSQL Instance             |
|  +--------------------------------------+  |
|  |          RuVector Extension          |  |
|  |  +--------+  +---------+  +-------+  |  |
|  |  | Engine |  | Workers |  | Index |  |  |
|  |  +--------+  +---------+  +-------+  |  |
|  +--------------------------------------+  |
|                                            |
|  +--------------------------------------+  |
|  |           Data Directory             |  |
|  |  vectors/ graphs/ indexes/ wal/      |  |
|  +--------------------------------------+  |
+--------------------------------------------+
```

**Use case**: Development, small-medium deployments (< 100M vectors)

### Mode 2: Postgres + RuVector Cluster

```
+------------------+      +------------------+
|   PostgreSQL 1   |      |   PostgreSQL 2   |
|  (Primary)       |      |  (Replica)       |
+--------+---------+      +--------+---------+
         |                         |
         | WAL Stream              | WAL Apply
         |                         |
+--------v-------------------------v---------+
|              RuVector Cluster              |
|  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +------+ |
|  | Node1 |  | Node2 |  | Node3 |  | ...  | |
|  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +------+ |
|                                             |
|  Distributed HNSW | Sharded Graph | GNN    |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

**Use case**: Production, large deployments (100M+ vectors)

### v2 Cluster Mode Clarification

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|              CLUSTER DEPLOYMENT DECISION                          |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

v2 cluster mode is a SEPARATE SERVICE with a stable RPC API.
The Postgres extension acts as a CLIENT to the cluster.

ARCHITECTURE OPTIONS:

Option A: SIDECAR (per Postgres instance)
  • RuVector cluster node co-located with each Postgres
  • Pros: Low latency, simple networking
  • Cons: Resource contention, harder to scale independently
  • Use when: Latency-sensitive, moderate scale

Option B: SHARED SERVICE (separate cluster)
  • Dedicated RuVector cluster serving multiple Postgres instances
  • Pros: Independent scaling, resource isolation
  • Cons: Network latency, requires service discovery
  • Use when: Large scale, multi-tenant

PROTOCOL:
  • gRPC with protobuf serialization
  • mTLS for authentication
  • Connection pooling in extension

PARTITION ASSIGNMENT:
  • Consistent hashing for shard routing
  • Automatic rebalancing on node join/leave
  • Partition map cached in extension shared memory

PARTITION MAP VERSIONING AND FENCING:
  • partition_map_version: monotonic counter incremented on any change
  • lease_epoch: obtained from cluster leader, prevents split-brain
  • Extension rejects stale map updates unless epoch matches current
  • On leader failover:
    1. New leader increments epoch
    2. Extensions must re-fetch map with new epoch
    3. Stale-epoch operations return ESTALE, client retries

v2 RECOMMENDATION:
  Start with Mode 1 (embedded). Add cluster mode only when:
  • Dataset exceeds single-node memory
  • Need independent scaling of compute/storage
  • Multi-region deployment required

|  PostgreSQL Heap is AUTHORITATIVE for:                           |
|    • Row existence and visibility (MVCC xmin/xmax)               |
|    • Transaction commit status                                    |

|  RuVector Engine Index is EVENTUALLY CONSISTENT:                 |
|    • Bounded lag window (configurable, default 100ms)            |
|    • Never returns invisible tuples (heap recheck)               |
|    • Never resurrects deleted vectors                             |
|                                                                   |
|  v2 HYBRID MODEL:                                                 |
|    • SYNCHRONOUS: Hot tier mutations, primary HNSW inserts       |
|    • ASYNCHRONOUS: Compaction, tier moves, graph maintenance     |
|                                                                   |

## Security Considerations

### Integrity Event Signing

All integrity state changes are cryptographically signed:

```rust
struct IntegrityEvent {
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    event_type: IntegrityEventType,
    previous_state: IntegrityState,
    new_state: IntegrityState,
    lambda_cut: f64,
    witness_edges: Vec<EdgeId>,
    signature: Ed25519Signature,
}
```

### Access Control

- Leverages PostgreSQL GRANT/REVOKE
- Separate roles for:
  - `ruvector_admin`: Full access
  - `ruvector_operator`: Maintenance operations
  - `ruvector_user`: Query and insert only

### Audit Trail

- All administrative operations logged
- Integrity events stored in `ruvector_integrity_events`
- Optional export to external SIEM

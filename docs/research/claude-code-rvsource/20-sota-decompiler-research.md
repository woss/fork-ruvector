# 20 - SOTA Decompiler Research: Bundle Decompilation and Source Recovery

**Status**: Research complete — **all proposed techniques implemented and validated** (2026-04-03)

## Executive Summary

This document surveys state-of-the-art approaches for JavaScript bundle decompilation
and source recovery, assesses their feasibility with RuVector's existing crate ecosystem,
and proposes a combined algorithm leveraging MinCut graph partitioning, self-learning
name inference (SONA), and witness-chain provenance for confidence-scored reconstruction.

The key insight: RuVector already possesses the core primitives (subpolynomial MinCut,
IIT Phi integration measurement, HNSW vector search, witness chains) that no existing
decompiler combines. The research below maps each SOTA technique to an existing crate
and identifies the integration work required.

## 1. Academic and Industry SOTA

### 1.1 JSNice (ETH Zurich, 2015)

**Paper**: "Predicting Program Properties" (Raychev, Vechev, Krause -- POPL 2015)

**Approach**: Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) trained on a large corpus of open-source
JavaScript. Predicts original variable names and type annotations from minified code by
learning statistical correlations between program structure and naming conventions.

**Key techniques**:
- Build a dependency network from the AST (data-flow edges, scope edges, call edges)
- Each variable becomes a node; edges encode structural relationships
- CRF inference assigns the most likely original name to each node
- Achieves ~63% exact-match accuracy on variable names in their 2015 evaluation

**Limitations**: Trained on pre-ES6 code; no module boundary detection; single-file only;
requires a large labeled training corpus; inference is slow on large bundles.

**RuVector relevance**: The dependency-network maps to ruvector-mincut's graph
infrastructure. Instead of CRFs, SONA learns naming patterns with <0.05ms adaptation.

### 1.2 DeGuard (ETH Zurich, 2017)

**Paper**: "Statistical Deobfuscation of Android Applications" (Bichsel et al. -- CCS 2017)

**Approach**: Extends JSNice to Android/Java deobfuscation using probabilistic graphical
models. Recovers class names, method names, and package structure from obfuscated APKs.

**Key techniques**:
- Build a program dependency graph (PDG) from bytecode
- Train on millions of unobfuscated apps from GitHub
- Joint prediction of names + types using structured prediction
- ~74% accuracy on class name recovery

**RuVector relevance**: PDG construction is analogous to our reference graph. DeGuard's
joint prediction suggests name inference and module detection should be coupled.

### 1.3 Other Notable Tools

**JSAI** (Jensen et al.): Abstract interpretation for JS type inference. Sound but too
expensive for 11 MB bundles. Structural insights better obtained via lighter AST analysis.

**Prepack/Hermes** (Meta): Prepack is a partial evaluator; Hermes compiles to bytecode
with debug info. Not directly applicable to esbuild bundles but Hermes's function
boundary encoding provides a model for what our decompiler should recover.

**Closure Compiler** (Google): Advanced mode reveals what survives minification:
property names on `@export` symbols, enum values, string constants. Module boundaries
collapse but import/export patterns leave distinctive signatures.

### 1.6 Source Map Format (VLQ Encoding)

**Spec**: Source Map Revision 3 (2011, de facto standard)

**Format**: JSON with a `mappings` field using Base64 VLQ-encoded segments:
- Each segment maps a generated position to an original position
- Fields: generated column, source file index, original line, original column, name index
- VLQ encoding: variable-length quantity using 6-bit groups with continuation bits

**Key insight for reconstruction**: Source maps are invertible. If we can establish a
mapping between beautified/reconstructed code and the minified source, we can generate
a valid source map. This is straightforward after module splitting and name inference --
each recovered element gets a mapping entry.

## 2. Graph-Based Module Boundary Detection

### 2.1 The MinCut Approach

**Core idea**: A webpack/esbuild bundle concatenates modules into a single scope. Each
original module has high internal cohesion (many references between its own declarations)
and low coupling to other modules (few cross-module references). This is precisely the
property that minimum cut algorithms detect.

**Algorithm**:

```
INPUT:  Minified bundle AST
OUTPUT: Set of module partitions with confidence scores

1. Parse bundle into AST
2. Extract top-level declarations D = {d1, d2, ..., dn}
3. Build reference graph G = (D, E) where:
   - Nodes = declarations
   - Edge (di, dj) exists if di references dj
   - Weight(di, dj) = reference_count(di, dj) * proximity_bonus(di, dj)
4. Apply hierarchical MinCut to find natural partitions:
   a. Compute global MinCut of G
   b. Recursively partition each side
   c. Stop when cut value exceeds threshold (high cohesion within partition)
5. Score each partition by internal_edges / boundary_edges ratio
```

**Feasibility with ruvector-mincut**: HIGH. The crate already provides:
- `DynamicGraph` with weighted edges (graph/mod.rs)
- `ClusterHierarchy` for hierarchical decomposition (cluster/mod.rs)
- Subpolynomial-time exact MinCut via `WitnessTree` (witness/mod.rs)
- WASM bindings for browser execution (wasm/mod.rs)
- Approximate algorithm for initial fast partitioning (algorithm/approximate.rs)

**Estimated integration work**: Build an AST-to-graph adapter that converts parsed
JavaScript declarations into `DynamicGraph` vertices and references into weighted edges.
The existing `ClusterHierarchy` handles the recursive partitioning directly.

### 2.2 Bundler Signature Detection

Bundlers leave distinctive patterns (webpack: `__webpack_require__`; esbuild: `__commonJS`,
`__toESM`; Rollup: flat concatenation; Parcel: `parcelRequire`). When present, these
provide ground truth. When absent (aggressive esbuild), MinCut becomes essential.

### 2.3 IIT Phi as Module Cohesion Metric

A novel application of ruvector-consciousness: use IIT Phi (Integrated Information
Theory) to measure how "integrated" each candidate module partition is.

**Intuition**: A well-recovered module should be highly integrated -- removing any
part of it significantly changes the information processing of the whole. Phi
quantifies exactly this property.

**Algorithm**:
```
For each candidate partition P:
  1. Build transition matrix T from the reference subgraph of P
  2. Compute Phi(T) using MinCutPhiEngine (fast, uses ruvector-mincut internally)
  3. High Phi = high integration = likely a real module
  4. Low Phi = loose collection = probably an incorrect partition boundary
```

**Feasibility**: The `mincut_phi.rs` module already implements exactly this -- using
MinCut-guided partition search to compute Phi efficiently. We just need to feed it
the code reference graph instead of a neural transition matrix.

## 3. Self-Learning Name Inference

### 3.1 Context Sources for Name Recovery

Minification destroys local variable names but preserves several context sources:

| Source | Survival Rate | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| String literals | 100% | `"tools/call"`, `"initialize"` |
| Property names | 100% (unless Closure advanced) | `.permissionMode`, `.canUseTool` |
| Error messages | 100% | `"Failed to resolve model"` |
| API endpoints | 100% | `"/v1/messages"` |
| Enum-like constants | ~90% | `"bypassPermissions"`, `"default"` |
| Module path strings | ~80% | `"node:fs"`, `"./utils"` |
| Console/log prefixes | ~70% | `"[MCP]"`, `"[Agent]"` |

### 3.2 Name Inference Algorithm

```
INPUT:  Minified function f with mangled name (e.g., "s$")
OUTPUT: Predicted original name with confidence score

1. EXTRACT context vectors:
   a. String literals used in f -> embed via HNSW
   b. Property names accessed in f -> semantic grouping
   c. Called functions and their inferred names -> propagation
   d. Parameter count and usage patterns -> structural fingerprint
   e. Return type patterns -> type inference

2. MATCH against known patterns:
   a. HNSW search: find similar context vectors in training corpus
   b. Pattern rules: string "tools/call" + property "method" => MCP-related
   c. Structural matching: async generator with yield* => agent loop variant

3. PROPAGATE names through call graph:
   a. If callee has high-confidence name, use it to constrain caller's name
   b. If parameter is passed to named function, infer parameter's role
   c. Bidirectional propagation until convergence

4. SCORE confidence:
   confidence = w1 * string_match_score
              + w2 * property_context_score
              + w3 * structural_similarity_score
              + w4 * cross_version_match_score
              + w5 * propagation_consistency_score
```

### 3.3 SONA Integration for Self-Learning

RuVector's SONA (Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture) provides <0.05ms adaptation,
making it ideal for online learning during decompilation:

**Training loop**:
1. User corrects a name prediction (e.g., "s$" is actually "agentLoop")
2. SONA adapts its weights using the correction as ground truth
3. All structurally similar functions get re-scored
4. Corrections propagate through the call graph
5. Future decompilation sessions benefit from accumulated corrections

**Advantage over JSNice**: JSNice requires offline retraining on a large corpus.
SONA adapts in real-time from individual corrections, accumulating expertise over
multiple decompilation sessions via EWC++ (Elastic Weight Consolidation), which
prevents catastrophic forgetting of earlier patterns.

### 3.4 HNSW-Accelerated Similarity Search

For name inference, we need to find code fragments similar to the one being analyzed.
RuVector's HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index provides 150x-12,500x
faster search than brute-force:

1. Embed each function's context vector (strings, properties, structure)
2. Index embeddings in HNSW
3. For each unknown function, find k-nearest neighbors in the index
4. Transfer names from known neighbors weighted by similarity

This enables "few-shot" name recovery: even a handful of manually identified functions
can seed the HNSW index and bootstrap inference for the entire bundle.

## 4. Cross-Version Analysis

### 4.1 Structural Fingerprinting

When multiple versions of the same bundle exist (as we have: v0.2.x, v1.0.x, v2.0.x,
v2.1.x of Claude Code), cross-version comparison dramatically improves recovery:

**Fingerprint computation**:
```
fingerprint(f) = hash(
  ast_structure(f),           // Shape of the AST (ignoring names)
  string_literals(f),         // Sorted set of string constants
  property_accesses(f),       // Set of property names used
  call_arity_pattern(f),      // Number and position of arguments
  control_flow_shape(f)       // if/else/loop structure
)
```

**Cross-version matching**:
```
For versions V1, V2 of the same bundle:
  For each function f1 in V1:
    For each function f2 in V2:
      if fingerprint(f1) == fingerprint(f2):
        f1 and f2 are the same original function
        if name(f1) != name(f2):
          both are minified variants of the same original name
```

### 4.2 Version Diff for Name Stability

Across versions, some functions gain or lose string literals, but their core structure
remains stable. By tracking which names are stable across versions, we increase
confidence in those predictions:

- Name appears in all versions with same fingerprint -> confidence += 0.3
- Name appears in most versions -> confidence += 0.15
- Name appears in only one version -> no bonus (might be version-specific)

### 4.3 Leveraging Existing Extracted Source

The research series already has extracted source from 4 versions (v0.2.x through v2.1.x)
with ~50 key functions named per version. This cross-version corpus provides labeled
training data that no external tool has access to.

## 5. Source Map Reconstruction

### 5.1 Generation Pipeline

```
Phase 1: Beautification Map
  minified.js (col 4523) -> beautified.js (line 127, col 4)
  Standard source map from any prettifier (e.g., Prettier)

Phase 2: Module Split Map
  beautified.js (line 127) -> modules/mcp-client.js (line 23)
  Generated from MinCut partition boundaries

Phase 3: Name Recovery Map
  modules/mcp-client.js:23 name "s$" -> original name "agentLoop"
  Generated from name inference results

Phase 4: Composite Map
  Compose all three maps into a single source map:
  minified.js -> original-reconstructed/mcp-client.js
  With original names attached to each mapping segment
```

### 5.2 Confidence-Annotated Source Maps

Standard source maps have no confidence field. We extend the format with a custom
`x_ruvector_confidence` field:

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "sources": ["modules/mcp-client.js"],
  "names": ["agentLoop", "resolveModel"],
  "mappings": "AAAA,SAAS...",
  "x_ruvector_confidence": {
    "modules": { "mcp-client.js": 0.92 },
    "names": { "agentLoop": 0.95, "resolveModel": 0.87 },
    "overall": 0.89
  },
  "x_ruvector_witness": "<witness-chain-hash>"
}
```

## 6. Confidence Scoring Methodology

### 6.1 Confidence Dimensions

| Dimension | Range | Inputs |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Module boundary | 0.0-1.0 | MinCut ratio, Phi integration, bundler signatures |
| Variable name | 0.0-1.0 | String context, cross-version match, propagation depth |
| Type inference | 0.0-1.0 | Property access patterns, call signatures |
| Overall reconstruction | 0.0-1.0 | Weighted combination of above |

### 6.2 Scoring Functions

**Module boundary confidence**:
```
C_module(P) = alpha * (internal_edges / total_edges)         // cohesion
            + beta  * (1 - boundary_edges / total_edges)     // separation
            + gamma * phi(P) / max_phi                       // integration
            + delta * bundler_signature_match(P)             // ground truth
```
where alpha + beta + gamma + delta = 1.0 (default: 0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2)

**Name confidence**:
```
C_name(n) = w1 * string_evidence(n)            // 0-1: string literal support
          + w2 * property_evidence(n)           // 0-1: property name correlation
          + w3 * cross_version_stability(n)     // 0-1: stable across versions
          + w4 * call_graph_consistency(n)       // 0-1: consistent with callers/callees
          + w5 * corpus_frequency(n)             // 0-1: common name in JS codebases
```
where w1 + w2 + w3 + w4 + w5 = 1.0 (default: 0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1)

### 6.3 Witness Chain Integration

Every confidence score is recorded in an RVF witness chain (using
ruvector-cognitive-container), providing auditability, reproducibility,
tamper evidence, and provenance linking decompilation results to their evidence.

## 7. Proposed Combined Algorithm

### 7.1 Pipeline: MinCut + SONA + Witness Chains

**Stage 1 -- Parse**: Bundle to AST, extract declarations, build reference graph, detect
bundler signatures. Output: `DynamicGraph` G + bundler metadata.

**Stage 2 -- Module Detection** (ruvector-mincut): Approximate MinCut for fast initial
partitioning, exact MinCut refinement on borderline cases, Phi integration scoring,
merge/split to optimize partition quality. Output: Module partitions with confidence.

**Stage 3 -- Name Inference** (SONA + HNSW): Extract context vectors, HNSW search
against known-name corpus, SONA online learning from corrections, call-graph propagation,
cross-version fingerprint matching. Output: Name predictions with confidence.

**Stage 4 -- Source Maps**: Beautify per-module, generate and compose source maps,
attach confidence annotations. Output: Reconstructed source tree + source maps.

**Stage 5 -- Witness**: Record all decisions in witness chain, compute overall
confidence, generate verification report. Output: RVF chain + confidence report.

### 7.2 RuVector Crate Mapping

## 9. Key Answers to Research Questions

**Q1: Can MinCut reliably detect original module boundaries in an esbuild bundle?**

Yes, with caveats. esbuild's flat concatenation style produces bundles where module
boundaries correspond to natural graph cuts. The approach works best when:
- Modules have clear separation of concerns (most real codebases)
- Cross-module references are sparser than intra-module references
- Bundler wrapper patterns provide additional boundary signals

Expected accuracy: 85-95% for well-structured codebases, 70-85% for tightly coupled code.

**Q2: What is SOTA for recovering original variable names from minified JS?**

JSNice (2015) achieved ~63% exact match. More recent transformer-based approaches
(DIRE, VarCLR, 2021-2023) achieve 65-72% on benchmarks. The practical ceiling is
around 75-80% because some names are genuinely ambiguous from structure alone.

RuVector's advantage: cross-version data and SONA online learning can push accuracy
to 80-90% for specific codebases where we have version history.

**Q3: How can cross-version diffing improve name inference?**

Dramatically. Functions with identical AST structure and string literals across versions
are definitively the same function, even if minified names change. This provides:
- Ground truth anchors for propagation
- Validation of inference (name stable across versions = higher confidence)
- Training data for SONA (each version is a labeled example)

**Q4: What confidence metrics are used in decompilation research?**

- JSNice: marginal probabilities from CRF inference (per-variable)
- DeGuard: posterior probabilities from PGM (per-name)
- Binary decompilation (Hex-Rays): heuristic confidence levels (low/medium/high)
- No existing tool combines multiple dimensions as proposed here

**Q5: How do existing tools handle source map generation from minified code?**

Most tools (uglify-js, terser) only generate source maps during minification, not
after the fact. Our approach of composing beautification + module-split + name-recovery
maps into a reverse source map is novel.

1. Module boundaries are detected algorithmically (not heuristically)
2. Every inferred name carries a confidence score
3. The entire decompilation is verifiable via witness chain
4. The system improves with every run via self-learning
5. Inference runs in pure Rust with zero external dependencies
